    "test_1='''U: 'Want to have fat loss'\n",
    "A: 'Awesome! Fat loss can be a journey, kind of like leveling up in a video game. What’s your current routine like? Are you focusing more on diet, exercise, or both? Let’s figure out a plan that suits you!'\n",
    "U: 'Diet'\n",
    "A: 'Great choice! Diet plays a huge role in fat loss. Think of it like choosing the right fuel for your body. Are you currently following any specific diet, or do you have any favorite foods you want to include or avoid? We can create something that feels good for you!'\n",
    "U: 'I want to know how I can plan my meal for the day.'\n",
    "A: 'Sure thing! Planning your meals can be super helpful. Let’s break it down like a movie script. \n",
    "\n",
    "For breakfast, think of something filling but light, like a bowl of poha or upma with some veggies. For lunch, maybe a portion of brown rice or roti with dal and a side of sabzi. \n",
    "\n",
    "Evening snacks can be something like roasted chana or a fruit chaat. And for dinner, you could go for grilled chicken or paneer with a salad. \n",
    "\n",
    "How does that sound? Any specific foods you love or want to include?'\n",
    "U: 'Can I include my protein shake in breakfast'\n",
    "A: 'Absolutely! A protein shake can be a great addition to your breakfast. It’s like the superhero sidekick to your meal, boosting your protein intake and keeping you full. Just make sure to balance it out with some carbs and healthy fats. \n",
    "\n",
    "You could blend it with a banana and some nuts or seeds for extra nutrition. How do you usually make your protein shake?'\n",
    "U: 'Same as u said'\n",
    "A: 'Nice! That sounds like a solid plan. Adding a banana and nuts will give you that extra energy kick to start your day. Just like a good chai, it’s all about the right mix! \n",
    "\n",
    "Are you thinking of any specific workouts to pair with your diet for fat loss?'\n",
    "U: 'I have hypothyroidism..how can I overcome it'\n",
    "A: 'Managing hypothyroidism is like tuning a musical instrument; it requires the right balance. It's usually treated with medication, but lifestyle changes can also help. Are you currently on any medication for it?'\n",
    "U: 'Yes'\n",
    "A: 'Got it! Managing hypothyroidism often involves medication like levothyroxine. It's important to take it as prescribed and have regular check-ups with your doctor to monitor your thyroid levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of lifestyle, a balanced diet and regular exercise can help manage symptoms. Foods rich in iodine, selenium, and zinc can be beneficial. Have you had your thyroid levels checked recently?'\n",
    "U: 'Yes'\n",
    "A: 'That's good to hear. Regular monitoring is key. Since you're already on medication, focusing on a healthy lifestyle can complement your treatment. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms related to hypothyroidism, like fatigue or weight gain?'\n",
    "U: 'What food items can I include n exclude from my meal'\n",
    "A: 'When it comes to hypothyroidism, certain foods can be more beneficial than others. Including foods rich in iodine, like fish and dairy, can be helpful. Selenium-rich foods like nuts and seeds, especially Brazil nuts, are also good. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the flip side, it might be wise to limit goitrogenic foods like raw cruciferous vegetables (e.g., cabbage, broccoli) as they can interfere with thyroid function if consumed in large amounts. Cooking them usually reduces their goitrogenic effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do you have any dietary preferences or restrictions I should consider?'\n",
    "U: 'How can I reduce my thighs fat....and bring them back in shape'\n",
    "A: 'Getting those thighs back in shape is totally doable! Think of it like sculpting a statue. Combining targeted exercises with a healthy diet can really help. \n",
    "\n",
    "For exercises, you can try squats, lunges, and leg raises. They’re like the power trio for your thighs! Adding some cardio, like brisk walking or cycling, can also help burn fat. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of diet, focusing on lean proteins, whole grains, and plenty of veggies will support your goals. Have you tried any specific workouts before, or are you looking for something new?'\n",
    "U: 'Yes I have tried all..is there something new'\n",
    "A: 'Got it! If you’re looking for something fresh, how about trying High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)? It’s like a rollercoaster ride for your metabolism! You alternate between short bursts of intense activity and rest. It can be super effective for fat loss and can be done with bodyweight exercises or even with weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another fun option could be dance workouts or kickboxing. They’re not just effective but also a blast! Have you ever tried any dance classes or kickboxing sessions?'''\n",
    "\n",
    "test_2 = '''A: 'Hello! How can I assist you with your health today? Are you experiencing any specific symptoms or concerns?'\n",
    "U: 'Yes'\n",
    "A: 'Got it! Let's continue with your symptoms. You mentioned itchy eyes and sneezing when you rub your nose. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do you also experience any other symptoms like a runny nose, nasal congestion, or throat irritation?'\n",
    "U: 'No leave that'\n",
    "A: 'Alright, let's focus on what you need. How can I assist you today? Are there any specific health concerns or symptoms you'd like to discuss?'\n",
    "U: 'This is another problem'\n",
    "A: 'Got it! Let's start fresh. Could you please describe the new problem or symptoms you're experiencing? This will help me understand how best to assist you.'\n",
    "U: 'Naa left hand laagutundi'\n",
    "A: 'Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that your left hand is hurting. Can you describe the type of pain you're experiencing? Is it sharp, dull, throbbing, or something else?'\n",
    "U: 'Can you understand telugu'\n",
    "A: 'Yes, I can understand Telugu. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's continue with your left hand pain. Is the pain localized to a specific area, like the wrist, fingers, or elbow, or is it more generalized throughout the entire hand?'\n",
    "U: 'Entire hand'\n",
    "A: 'Thanks for clarifying. Is there any swelling, redness, or warmth in your left hand? These symptoms can help determine if there's inflammation or an injury.'\n",
    "U: 'No'\n",
    "A: 'Alright, no swelling, redness, or warmth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Have you experienced any recent injuries or overuse of your left hand, such as lifting heavy objects, repetitive motions, or any trauma?'\n",
    "U: 'No'\n",
    "A: 'Got it. Since there's no recent injury or overuse, let's consider other possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you have any numbness or tingling sensations in your left hand? This can help determine if there might be a nerve-related issue.'\n",
    "U: 'What is numbness tell me in telugu'\n",
    "A: 'Numbness అంటే తెలుగులో \"\"నిస్సత్తువ\"\" లేదా \"\"మందగింపు\"\" అని అంటారు. \n",
    "\n",
    "మీ చేతిలో నిస్సత్తువ లేదా మందగింపు ఉందా?'\n",
    "U: 'No'\n",
    "A: 'Thanks for confirming. \n",
    "\n",
    "Have you noticed any weakness in your left hand, like difficulty in gripping objects or performing tasks that require hand strength?'\n",
    "U: 'I think it's gas pain'\n",
    "A: 'I see, you think it might be gas pain. Sometimes, gas pain can radiate and cause discomfort in different areas, including the chest and back, but it's less common for it to affect the hand directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you experienced any chest discomfort, bloating, or changes in your bowel movements recently? These symptoms can help us determine if gas might be the underlying cause.'\n",
    "U: 'Yes'\n",
    "A: 'Thank you for sharing that. \n",
    "\n",
    "Have you noticed any relief in your hand pain after passing gas or having a bowel movement? This can help us understand if the pain is indeed related to gastrointestinal issues.'\n",
    "U: 'No'\n",
    "A: 'Alright, since the hand pain doesn't seem to be relieved by passing gas or having a bowel movement, it might be less likely that it's directly related to gastrointestinal issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you experienced any recent stress or anxiety? Sometimes, stress can manifest as physical symptoms, including pain in various parts of the body.'\n",
    "U: 'Yes'\n",
    "A: 'Thank you for sharing that. Stress and anxiety can indeed cause physical symptoms, including pain in different parts of the body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you noticed if the pain in your left hand gets worse during periods of high stress or anxiety?'\n",
    "U: 'May be'\n",
    "A: 'Got it. Stress can sometimes exacerbate physical symptoms, but let's explore a bit more to be thorough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your left hand? These symptoms can help us determine if there might be a nerve-related issue.'\n",
    "U: 'No'\n",
    "A: 'Alright, no numbness, tingling, or weakness. Let's consider other possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you recently engaged in any activities that might have strained your hand, such as typing for long periods, lifting heavy objects, or any repetitive motions?'\n",
    "U: 'Yes'\n",
    "A: 'Thank you for that information. Repetitive strain or overuse can often lead to pain in the hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Could you describe the type of pain you're experiencing? For example, is it a sharp, stabbing pain, a dull ache, or a burning sensation?'\n",
    "U: 'Sharp stabbing pain'\n",
    "A: 'Thank you for describing the pain as sharp and stabbing. This type of pain can sometimes be associated with conditions like tendinitis or carpal tunnel syndrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you noticed any swelling, redness, or warmth in the area where you're experiencing the pain?'\n",
    "U: 'Give me the results how many do you ask'\n",
    "A: 'I understand you're eager for results, but to provide a personalized and accurate assessment, I need to gather a bit more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you noticed any swelling, redness, or warmth in the area where you're experiencing the sharp, stabbing pain? This can help us determine if there's inflammation or an injury.'\n",
    "U: 'No'\n",
    "A: 'Thank you for clarifying that there's no swelling, redness, or warmth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given your symptoms of sharp, stabbing pain in the left hand without numbness, tingling, or visible inflammation, and considering recent repetitive activities, it might be related to overuse or strain.\n",
    "\n",
    "To narrow it down further, could you tell me if the pain worsens with specific movements or activities, such as gripping objects or typing?'\n",
    "U: 'Typing'\n",
    "A: 'Thank you for that detail. It sounds like the pain might be related to repetitive strain from typing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you experience the pain more during or after long periods of typing, or does it persist even when you're not typing?'\n",
    "U: 'Taking too long'\n",
    "A: 'I understand, and I appreciate your patience. Let's streamline this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the pain worsens with typing and there's no swelling, redness, or warmth, it could be related to repetitive strain injury (RSI) or carpal tunnel syndrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "To narrow it down, do you feel any pain or discomfort in your wrist or forearm, or is it localized only to your hand?'\n",
    "U: 'Bye! how many questions you're asking like a lawyer are you a doctor or not?'\n",
    "A: 'I'm really sorry if it felt overwhelming! I'm here to help, not to make things complicated. Let's keep it simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on what you've shared, it sounds like repetitive strain from typing might be causing your hand pain. To ease the discomfort, you might want to take frequent breaks, stretch your hands, and consider ergonomic adjustments to your workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the pain persists or worsens, it would be a good idea to consult an orthopedist or a physiotherapist. They can provide a more detailed examination and specific treatments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take care, and feel free to reach out if you need more help!'\n",
    "U: 'Ergonomic meaning'\n",
    "A: 'Ergonomics is all about designing or arranging things to fit the natural capabilities and limitations of the human body. In the context of your workspace, ergonomic adjustments could involve things like adjusting the height of your chair, the position of your keyboard and mouse, or even the lighting to make your work environment more comfortable and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making ergonomic changes can help reduce strain on your body and prevent discomfort or pain from prolonged computer use. It's all about optimizing your workspace to support your health and well-being.'\n",
    "U: 'Thank you'\n",
    "A: 'You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further assistance in the future, feel free to reach out. Take care and have a wonderful day ahead!'\n",
    "A: 'Your feedback is really important to me. Are there any things you think I could have done better? Also, anything you liked about our interaction?'\n",
    "U: 'Please ask less questions and questions asking was repeating same'\n",
    "A: 'Thank you for sharing your feedback. I'll work on asking fewer questions and ensuring they are more varied in the future. Your input helps me improve and provide a better experience. If you have any more suggestions or need assistance, feel free to let me know. Have a great day!' '''\n",

       "  {'Assistant': 'Great choice! Diet plays a huge role in fat loss. Think of it like choosing the right fuel for your body. Are you currently following any specific diet, or do you have any favorite foods you want to include or avoid? We can create something that feels good for you!'},\n",
       "  {'Assistant': 'Sure thing! Planning your meals can be super helpful. Let’s break it down like a movie script. For breakfast, think of something filling but light, like a bowl of poha or upma with some veggies. For lunch, maybe a portion of brown rice or roti with dal and a side of sabzi. Evening snacks can be something like roasted chana or a fruit chaat. And for dinner, you could go for grilled chicken or paneer with a salad. How does that sound? Any specific foods you love or want to include?'},\n",
       "  {'Assistant': 'Absolutely! A protein shake can be a great addition to your breakfast. It’s like the superhero sidekick to your meal, boosting your protein intake and keeping you full. Just make sure to balance it out with some carbs and healthy fats. You could blend it with a banana and some nuts or seeds for extra nutrition. How do you usually make your protein shake?'},\n",
       "  {'Assistant': 'Nice! That sounds like a solid plan. Adding a banana and nuts will give you that extra energy kick to start your day. Just like a good chai, it’s all about the right mix! Are you thinking of any specific workouts to pair with your diet for fat loss?'}],\n",

       "  {'Assistant': \"Got it! Managing hypothyroidism often involves medication like levothyroxine. It's important to take it as prescribed and have regular check-ups with your doctor to monitor your thyroid levels. In terms of lifestyle, a balanced diet and regular exercise can help manage symptoms. Foods rich in iodine, selenium, and zinc can be beneficial. Have you had your thyroid levels checked recently?\"},\n",

       "  {'Assistant': 'When it comes to hypothyroidism, certain foods can be more beneficial than others. Including foods rich in iodine, like fish and dairy, can be helpful. Selenium-rich foods like nuts and seeds, especially Brazil nuts, are also good. On the flip side, it might be wise to limit goitrogenic foods like raw cruciferous vegetables (e.g., cabbage, broccoli) as they can interfere with thyroid function if consumed in large amounts. Cooking them usually reduces their goitrogenic effect. Do you have any dietary preferences or restrictions I should consider?'}],\n",
       " [{'Assistant': 'Getting those thighs back in shape is totally doable! Think of it like sculpting a statue. Combining targeted exercises with a healthy diet can really help. For exercises, you can try squats, lunges, and leg raises. They’re like the power trio for your thighs! Adding some cardio, like brisk walking or cycling, can also help burn fat. In terms of diet, focusing on lean proteins, whole grains, and plenty of veggies will support your goals. Have you tried any specific workouts before, or are you looking for something new?'},\n",
       "  {'Assistant': 'Got it! If you’re looking for something fresh, how about trying High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)? It’s like a rollercoaster ride for your metabolism! You alternate between short bursts of intense activity and rest. It can be super effective for fat loss and can be done with bodyweight exercises or even with weights. Another fun option could be dance workouts or kickboxing. They’re not just effective but also a blast! Have you ever tried any dance classes or kickboxing sessions?'}]]"
